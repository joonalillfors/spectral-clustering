# Description

Set of algorithms designed to partition graphs to k clusters while trying to minimize an objective function.

# How to run

In code/ directory, run ```python partition.py {graphName}```, where graphName is ca-GrQc or Oregon-1. The code will print out the objective function scores and cluster sizes. Resulting clusterings can be found in results/ directory for each of the different algorithms.
